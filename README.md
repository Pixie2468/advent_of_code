# 🎄 Advent of Code — My Progress & Review

This repository contains my personal solutions for **Advent of Code**, organized by year and day.
The purpose of this repo is to:

* 🧠 Practice problem‑solving and algorithms
* 🔄 Review and improve older solutions
* 🏗️ Track progress consistently
* 📚 Build a reference of patterns (DP, parsing, graph algorithms, recursion, etc.)
* 🚀 Improve coding habits and clean‑code structure

**Notes:**

* Each day contains a `solution.py` file (or multiple languages if needed).
* `notes.md` can be used for documenting approaches, optimizations, or mistakes.
* Inputs are not committed and are ignored with `.gitignore`.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

* Write **clean, readable, testable code**
* Practice key **data structures & algorithms**
* Explore multiple approaches where useful
* Revisit code to optimize or rewrite with improved patterns
* Maintain a long‑term archive of AoC attempts

## 🛠️ Running the Solutions

You can run individual days directly:

``` bash
python day1/day1.py
```

---

## ⚠️ Inputs Are Not Included

Advent of Code requests participants **not to share puzzle inputs**.
Input files are ignored using:

``` txt
day*.txt
```

---

## 📝 Reviewing & Improving Code

I will periodically revisit solutions to:

* Improve clarity and style
* Add comments or explanations
* Optimize slow code
* Try alternate solutions
* Document learning in `notes.md`

---

## 💬 Improvements & Notes

This repository is primarily for learning and long‑term improvement.
Any future revisions, cleanups, or alternate solutions will be documented here.
